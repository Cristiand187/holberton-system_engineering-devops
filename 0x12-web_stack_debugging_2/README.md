### [0. Run software as another user](./0-iamsomeonelese)



### [1. Run Nginx as Nginx](./1-run_nginx_as_nginx)
The root user is a superuser that can do anything on a Unix machine, the top administrator. Security wise, you must do everything that you can to prevent an attacker from logging in as root. With this in mind, itâ€™s a good practice not to run your web servers as root (which is the default for most configurations) and instead run the process as the less privileged nginx user instead. This way, if a hacker does find a security issue that allows them to break-in to your server, the impact is limited by the permissions of the nginx user.


### [2. 7 lines or less](./100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less)
Using what you did for task #1, make your fix short and sweet.
 * Your Bash script must be 7 lines long or less
 * There must be a new line at the end of the file
 * You respect Bash script requirements
 * You cannot use ;
 * You cannot use &&
 * You cannot use wget
 * You cannot execute your previous answer file (Do not include the name of the previous script in this one)
